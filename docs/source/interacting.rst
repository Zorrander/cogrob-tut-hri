Human robot Interaction
=======================

We use natural language as a privileged way of interaction with the system. It can be oral requests, in which case we use Google Speech Recognition
to translate it to computable text or written through the GUI.
When interacting with the robot, the communication layer transforms the inputs into a (<action>, <target>) pair and transmit it to the reasoning layer.
