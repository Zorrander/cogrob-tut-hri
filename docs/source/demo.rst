Demonstrating a new skills
==========================

At this point, the different steps composing a skill are known but the robot does not know how to actually perform them. For now, this is solved by demonstrating
the motions.

Using the GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the interface can be seen all the skills available on the robot. Once selected the different steps are fetched from the knowledge base and the user can
demonstrate them individually.
