Awareness in Human-Robot Interaction for Collaborative Tasks documentation
==========================================================================

The Awareness in Human-Robot Interaction for Collaborative Tasks project is composed of several ROS packages that can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/Zorrander/cogrob-tut-hri>`_. We welcome any suggestion for improvements.

The project is composed of :

 * A knowledge base server storing information about the environment and different skills that can performed by a robot. It also provides an interface to teach new knowledge.

 * A reasoning system to be deployed on a robot allowing for reasoning and collaborative task planning. For experiments we use the `Panda arm <https://www.franka.de/>`_ from Frakna Emika.
