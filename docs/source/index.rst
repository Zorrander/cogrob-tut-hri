Human-Robot Interactive Learning documentation
============================================================

The Human-Robot Interactive Learning project is composed of several ROS packages that can be found on
`GitHub <https://github.com/Zorrander/cogrob-tut-hri>`_. We welcome any suggestion for improvements.

The two main components of the project are :

 * ``cogrob_tut_speech_recognition`` in charge of delivering meaningful tokens to the reasoning module from natural language inputs provided by the user.

 * ``cogrob_tut_reasoning``, analyzing the tokens of a spoken request to determine if it is able to perform it or not.
